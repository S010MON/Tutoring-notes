## Keywords Used in Java
Below is a list of keywords used in java and a brief description.

*Keyword* |	*Description*
----------|-----------
abstract 	|A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from) assert for debugging.
break 		|Breaks out of a loop or a switch block
case 		|Marks a block of code in switch statements
catch 		|Catches exceptions generated by try statements
class 		|Defines a class
continue 	|Continues to the next iteration of a loop
const 		|Defines a constant. Not in use - use final instead
default 	|Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
do 		|Used together with while to create a do-while loop
else 		|Used in conditional statements
enum 		|Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type
exports 	|Exports a package with a module. New in Java 9
extends 	|Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class)
final 		|A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override)
finally 	|Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not
for 		|Create a for loop
goto 		|Not in use, and has no function
if 		|Makes a conditional statement
implements 	|Implements an interface
import 		|Used to import a package, class or interface
instanceof 	|Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface
interface 	|Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods
module 		|Declares a module. New in Java 9
native 		|Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file (but in another language)
new 		|Creates new objects
package 	|Declares a package
private 	|An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class
protected 	|An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses
public 		|An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class
requires 	|Specifies required libraries inside a module. New in Java 9
return 		|Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method
static 		|A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class
strictfp 	|Restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations
super 		|Refers to superclass (parent) objects
switch 		|Selects one of many code blocks to be executed
synchronized 	|A non-access modifier, which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
this 		|Refers to the current object in a method or constructor
throw 		|Creates a custom error
throws 		|Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method
transient 	|A non-accesss modifier, which specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state
try 		|Creates a try...catch statement
var 		|Declares a variable. New in Java 10
void 		|Specifies that a method should not have a return value
volatile 	|Indicates that an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
while 		|Creates a while loop
