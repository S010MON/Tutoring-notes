Java Graphics

The Graphics and Graphics2D objects cannot be instantated, but are very useful for drawing shapes.

Within a JPanel call the "paintComponent()" method and pass it a Graphics object:

	public void drawStuff(Graphics g)
	{
		panel.paintComponent(g);

	}


The following shapes and lines can be drawn:

	Graphics.drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);

	Graphics.drawPolyline(int[] x^n, int[] y^n, int numOfPoints);

	Graphics.drawString(String text, int x, int y);


The following modifiers can be used to change aspects of the objects:

	Graphics.setStroke(new BasicStroke(int width));

	Graphics.setColor(Color.COLOR);

	Graphics.setFont(new Font (String fontName, FONT.bold, int textSize);
